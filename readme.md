#Viller's RuneScapeCacheTools

######A .NET library and interface for extracting and manipulating RuneScape's cache files.

A pre-compiled executable of the latest release is available from the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/Villermen/RuneScapeCacheTools/releases). Extract the archive and run RuneScapeCacheToolsGUI.exe to open the user interface.

####RuneScapeCacheTools can:

 - Extract the entire cache or single archives into separate files in a given directory. Decompressing and handing out extensions where appropriate.
 - Combine sound chunks from the soundtrack archive into full-fledged, named tracks.
 - Show a list of all soundtrack names, or a list of all the ones not present in the output directory (so you know what to load into the cache in-game).

####Soundtrack

I've uploaded all named tracks to youtube. Playlist can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLCViMm56RAFqVJKXi13VEFwz7Q_Bi4gR).
You can download the soundtrack we have created together with the tool from [my website](https://villermen.com/browser/music). It's as complete as possible. If you have extracted any tracks that are not (yet) downloadable in the file browser, you can contact me at any time. [An email](mailto:villermen@gmail.com) would probably be the best way to contact me.
